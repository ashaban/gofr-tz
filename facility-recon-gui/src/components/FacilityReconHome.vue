          <p>The diplomatic cable outlining the PEPFAR and Ministry of Health Data Alignment activity that was sent to your missions on July 11 requesting from host country Ministries of Health HIV program results for the most recent 12-month period for key indicators including: (1) number of people tested for HIV and were positive; (2) through Prevention of Mother-to-Child Transmission (PMTCT) program, number of women tested for HIV and were positive and on HIV treatment; (3) number of people newly initiating HIV treatment; (4) number of people currently on HIV treatment; and (5) number of people and percentage retained on HIV treatment. As indicated in the cable, S/GAC will support country teams in the organization and importation of these data, including expanded health information systems support and data visualization. This will be a multi-step process, including: (a) rapid review of current MoH health information systems; (b) mapping indicators and sites; (c) importing data into the DATIM database; and (d) identification and technical support to areas needing strengthening for routine data availability and use.</p>
